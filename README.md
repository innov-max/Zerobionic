## Introduction

Zerobionic is an innovative robotic interface designed to enhance STEM education for hearing-impaired students. Our goal is to break down communication barriers and provide equal educational opportunities for deaf and dumb students, both onsite and remotely.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of Zerobionic is to facilitate effective communication and interactive learning for hearing-impaired students in STEM subjects. By leveraging a human arm prosthesis trained on a STEM dataset, Zerobionic transcribes and translates complex STEM concepts in real-time, making them accessible to students who otherwise face significant challenges in these areas.

## Problem Statement

Traditional education methods often exclude hearing-impaired students from STEM education due to communication barriers and lack of specialized resources. This exclusion limits their career opportunities in fields like engineering, robotics, and IoT.

## Solution

Zerobionic addresses this problem through:
- **Real-time Translation**: Translates spoken words into sign language and vice versa.
- **Visual Aids**: Uses images and GIFs to illustrate complex STEM concepts.
- **Remote Learning**: Facilitates education in underserved and remote areas without the need for personal smartphones.
- **Scalability**: Modular design allows for easy adaptation to various educational settings and regions.

## Achievements

- **Pilots**: Engaged 78 deaf students in Garissa and Machakos counties, Kenya.
- **Awards**: Received the Global Learning Council Award.
- **Media Features**: Highlighted by Kenya Nation TV, Trace Africa, and Strathmore University Engineering School.

## Future Goals

- **Short-term (12-24 months)**: Expand to 20 additional schools in Kenya, enhance technology, and establish strategic partnerships.
- **Long-term (3-5 years)**: Scale globally, reaching over 100 schools, integrate with educational technologies, and become a leader in inclusive STEM education.
